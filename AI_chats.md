- Gemini (Gemini 1.5 Flash) ~17.08.2024 [Implementing early stopping with StableBaselines 3](https://g.co/gemini/share/031b42019a6e)  
  _This chat helped me learn about early stopping, which I simultaneously read up on in the StableBaselines documentation, then used a combination of what I learned from both sources in `tests/nn_rl_stable_baselines/nn_rl_training.py`. Code from this chat was not directly copied, but due to the simplicity of the problem is still similar._
