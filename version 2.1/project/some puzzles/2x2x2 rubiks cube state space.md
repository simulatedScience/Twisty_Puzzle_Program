# 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube

## Setting

We consider the 2x2x2 Rubik's cube. It has $6$ sides with $4$ color points each. The puzzle has $8$ corner pieces and nothing else.

It is possible to swap two adjacent corners without changing anything else in the puzzle. Therefor it is also possible to swap any two corners by repeatedly swapping adjacent ones.

It is NOT possible to rotate a single corner $120$° or $240$°. All corner rotations must be a multiple of $360$° when added together.

## Derivation

Therefor the set of all possible states can be generated by permuting all corners: with $8$ corners there are $8!$ ways to do that.

In addition we can rotate each corner in $3$ different directions. Therefor we have $8! \cdot 3^8$ possible states. But that's counting the invalid rotations described before. So we have to devide by $3$ since the sum of all corner rotations can be equal to $120 \mod 360$, $240\mod 360$ or $0\mod 360$ of which only the last one is valid.

## Result

So in general there are $8! \cdot 3^7 = 88,179,840$ possible states of a 2x2x2 Rubik's cube.
