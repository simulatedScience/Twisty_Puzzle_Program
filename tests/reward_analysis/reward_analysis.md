# Reward Analysis for RL-Agents solving Twisty Puzzles

Investigate the influence of:
- different reward functions
- different action sets
- different solution strategies (simulated by different scrambling functions)


1. Scramble the puzzle randomly from a solved state using a given action set.
2. After each move, record the value of the reward function.
3. Repeat for many scrambles, averaging the results
4. Plot the average reward after each move in a grid.
