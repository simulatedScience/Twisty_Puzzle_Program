  _After several messages, code was partially copied with some modifications to make it more efficient, calculating fewer factorials._

- GPT-4o 28.08.2024: [brainstorming to fix 180Â° rotation animations](https://chatgpt.com/share/40f1633a-fae4-4881-99e1-7b8641166ba0)  
  _Main ideas were my own, ChatGPT added suggestions for algorithms to use in an implementation and explained pro's and con's of the options._

- GPT-4o 29.08.2024: [implementing ideas for point- and piece orbit-calculations](https://chatgpt.com/share/42fdec47-8ce7-4808-b5b7-41c46560a406)  
  _After a few messages, code was almost directly copied to `tests/puzzle_piece_orbits.py`_

- Gemini (Gemini 1.5 Flash) ~17.08.2024 [Implementing early stopping with StableBaselines 3](https://g.co/gemini/share/031b42019a6e)  
  _This chat helped me learn about early stopping, which I simultaneously read up on in the StableBaselines documentation, then used a combination of what I learned from both sources in `tests/nn_rl_stable_baselines/nn_rl_training.py`. Code from this chat was not directly copied, but due to the simplicity of the problem is still similar._

- GPT-4o 16.09.2024 [parallel RL training with sb3 on GPU](https://chatgpt.com/share/66e93a8c-4228-8007-bb84-da1a41ac4412)
  _unused, read [sb3 documentation](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/vec_envs.html) instead for more reliable information. Provided some inspiration for other RL methods to try if necessary._

- GPT-4o 19.09.2024 [fix incorrect inverses in definition of Geaer Cube Ultimate](https://chatgpt.com/share/66ec2d4e-31c0-8007-b686-8d2637191c0e)  
  _Saved some simple but tedious work to correct an error resulting from a minor bug. Doing this without an LLM would have taken a few minutes._

- GPT-4o 27.09.2024 [Write simple data analysis code for test files](https://chatgpt.com/share/66f727ba-c71c-8007-8f86-aa279a19b6db)  
  _Saved time for coding some plots and basic evaluations. I have coded very similar graphs many times before, so ChatGPT was used purely to save time. I uploaded my test data file for one puzzle and described what graphs I wanted. After several messages and some manual adjustments for style of code and plots, the code was mostly copied to `src/au_modules/poilcy_analysis.py`._

- GPT-4o 15.10.2024 [vectorize binary multi-goal reward](https://chatgpt.com/share/670e3661-e8a0-8007-addc-691e70718889)  
  _Very simple modification to existing code. The output was partially used in `src/ai_modules/nn_rl_reward_factories.py` (added `[:, None]` to `state` for vectorization)._
